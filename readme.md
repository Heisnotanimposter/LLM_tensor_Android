DeepwaveSLM4 is an Android application that leverages a TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model to perform question-answering tasks using a BERT-based model. This project provides a streamlined approach to integrating TFLite models into an Android app and ensures proper data type handling for model inputs and outputs.

## Overview

DeepwaveSLM4 is designed to use a TFLite model for question-answering. The project ensures that the model inputs and outputs are handled correctly, particularly focusing on using the `FLOAT32` data type.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio
- Basic knowledge of Kotlin
- TensorFlow Lite model in `FLOAT32` format

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepwaveSLM4.git
   cd DeepwaveSLM4
   ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio:**
   
   - Open Android Studio.
   - Select "Open an existing project."
   - Navigate to the cloned repository and select the project directory.

3. **Set up the TensorFlow Lite model:**

   - Ensure you have a TFLite model in `FLOAT32` format.
   - Place the model file (`BertQA_Float32.tflite`) in the `app/src/main/assets` directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**

   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
   - Click the "Run" button in Android Studio.

2. **Using the application:**

   - Input your question in the provided text field.
   - Click the "Send" button to get the answer from the model.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Data Type Mismatch:**
  If you encounter an error like `Data type mismatch: Cannot convert between a TensorFlowLite tensor with type INT32 and a Java object of type [[F (which is compatible with the TensorFlowLite type FLOAT32)`, ensure that your model inputs and outputs are correctly formatted as `FLOAT32`.

- **Gradle Build Issues:**
  If the project fails to build, try running `gradle clean` and `gradle build` commands to ensure a fresh build environment.

### Example Error Log
